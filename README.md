# Salesforce-to-Salesforce-Integration

# Summary

Integrating data and records from Salesforce production environment of Ready Ready to an external Salesforce Org. Salesforce to Salesforce makes it easy for businesses using Salesforce to share records and get updated data on shared records.

# Problem Statement

In most cases, data from Salesforce is being pulled and transferred to an external data warehouse. Once the data is moved to an external data warehouse, we can perform various operations using that data. But what if we want to transfer data between two different Salesforce Organizations? Sharing of records among Salesforce organizations is easier than before by implementing ‘Salesforce-Salesforce’. With this feature, partners can collaborate more easily & effectively within & across Salesforce organizations. The benefit of this service is that using point-and-click integration, users may now collaborate in a real-time fashion with other external Salesforce instances and leverage strong reporting, workflow and business integration capabilities available on the platform.
