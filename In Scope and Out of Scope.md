# In Scope

1. Share records between two Salesforce instances in real time.
2. Control the type of records we share with our connected organizations by selecting which objects and fields to publish.
3. Connected organizations do not have direct access to records that we are sharing.
4. Any updates to shared information on the records are reflected on the other record.
5. After sharing, when viewing a shared record, the record's sharing status can be viewed on the header.
6. An Auto-Accept option is available. Upon selecting this option, records from the publishing org will be automatically accepted and the process will be entirely automatic.

# Out of Scope

1. Records need to be shared manually after creation in the source org.
